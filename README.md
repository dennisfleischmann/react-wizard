# Couple of goals

A new wizard is easy to create
- Wizard libary comes with the basic steps
- wizard-card
- New steps can be greated very easily by providing new custom step components (?)
- New componets has its own css file
- Wizard's styles can easily be changed by providing a new styles file (!)
  - Global style sheet to easily switch brands
  - Component level style sheet


  # Usage of Components and styles

   React-wizard library
    - Comes with basic components
    - Style sheet can be replaced or modified
      - Import of the global styles will happen on application level and not on library level
    - New custom components can be used
